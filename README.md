# Artifact - Knowledge Management Project

## How to run
First, load the ontology file with the instances. It has to be inside the `ontology` directory and in turtle format.

Next, install the dependencies (if needed).

Finally, run the commands:
```
cd artefact
streamlit run ui.py
```

And the UI should open in the browser.
